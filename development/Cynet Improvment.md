## Notes for user:
### Note 1:
When running the `flexroc` version of `AdaBoost` with python3, 
we need to modified the notebook a little bit:
```
auc_command = '../bin/flexroc -i {}  -w 1 -x 0 -C 1 -L 1 -E 0 -f .2 -t .9'.format(outfile)
output  = subprocess.check_output(auc_command,shell = True)
        
# ------------add this line if working with python3 -----------------
output = output.decode('utf8')
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
```
python2 probably doesn't need it since byte-like object is a python3 feature.

### Note 2
If we are going to do bi-class classification using AdaBoost,
we probably need to binarized the the target 
(the last column of the cvs file generated by `cynet_chunker` call). 

## Note for developer
### **Improvment** Run `run_pipeline()` in parallel
In perturbation, if we have $p$ percentages and $n$ variables, then we have $p^{n}$ many different many perturbed splits. 
When dataset is large, or $p$ or $n$ is big, we may want to run all the `run_pipeline()` calls in parallel, 
whithout copy models folder for each row (or entry).  
The implementation now cannot do not support this, 
since although we can save the `.res` file in separate folder, 
and the `*model_sel_[uuid].json` files cannot be overwritten because of the uuid, 
the `.log` files currently cannot be saved to a separated folder, 
and can be overwritten. 
There is a parameter named `LOG_PATH` in for `run_pipeline()`, but it seems it doesn't have much effect, 
because it get overwritten (on around line 1844-1847 of cynet.py) anyway.

### **Bug** petrubation_parallel vs perturbation
We have a function peturbation_parallel in the cynet class, which is a typo. 

### **Improvement** Automated RUNLEN and FLEX_TAIL_LEN from dates
Yi wrote two little pieces of code so that when `RUNLEN` and `FLEX_TAIL_LEN` in the `config.yaml` are given as -1, 
they could be calculated from `START_DATE`, `END_DATA`, `OOS_END_DATE`, `FREQ` in the `config.yaml` file.
Now the code is include in the user-side notebook/script 
(e.g. `usWeather_cynet_2_pred.py` or `usWeather_cynet_3_chunker.py`, etc).
But one day, Yi forgot to pass the calculated `RUNLEN` and `FLEX_TAIL_LEN` to `cynet_chunker`, 
but instead passed `-1` for both values. 
The result is that the `cynet` binary kept running forever. 
So we may want to consider add a safety check somewhere so that the wrapper or `cynet` warn the user `-1` is passed.
Or the inference of `RUNLEN` and `FLEX_TAIL_LEN` should instead be done on the `Cynet` side.

### **Bug** use of python string `strip()` function:
Quote from documentation of `.strip()`
> The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.

In cynet we sometimes want to change the extension, for example `.log`. But the if we use `strip(.log)` and the file path also STARTS with `log`, the leading `log` will also be striped. I suggest using `replace()` or `rstrip()`.

### **Bug** double counting caused by inclusive `pandas.DataFrame.loc` slicing:
The `DataFrame.loc[A:B]` is both inclusive for boundaries `A` and `B`. This will cause major problem when the temporal resolution of the raw log file lines up with the temproal discretization of cynet. For example, if we use 1 day resolution and the raw log files (feed to the cynet) only have dates and we use temporal frequence `1D` for cynet, then `loc['2016-01-01':'2016-01-02']` will in fact contain events on both 2016-01-01 and 2016-01-02, while the intended behavior is to count only events on 2016-01-01.

### **Improvment** Inconsistency of `cynet.spatioTemporal` and `cynet.cynet_chunk` in using partition file
1. Suppose we have binary partition, then `cynet_chunker` need a file with two columns with the first column being the coords (as in the `.coords` file) but `sp` needs just one column of the partition points;
2. `cynet_chunker` takes partition filename as a string, but for `sp` , one needs to put the filename in a bracket like `["partition_filename.csv"]`.
These inconsistency can be a little confusing for users, and since they probably don't have access to the binary source code, they probably couldn't figure them out either.

### *\[Improvment\]* About the `threshold` parameter in `spatioTemporal`
In case you want to keep all the time series no matter how sparse a time series is, you may want to set the `threshold` parameter in `spatioTemporal` to be zero. But the current cynet class code use `>=` and hence will keep time series that is entirely zero. Later developer may consider use `>` instead of `>=`.
