# Non-parametric vs Parametric Statistics

The main idea of nonparametric statistics is to make inferences about unknown quantities without resorting to
simple parametric reductions of the problem For example, suppose \\\(X \sim F\\\) , and we wish to estimate, say
\\\(E(X) or P(X > 1)\\\)

The approach taken by parametric statistics is to assume that F belongs to a family of distribution functions that can be
described by a small number of parameters â€“ e.g., the normal distribution:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} exp \{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \} $$

These parameters are then estimated, and we make inferences
about the quantities we were originally interested in (\\\(E(X)\\\) or \\\(P(X > 1)\\\)) based on assuming \\\(X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \\\)
