# Rate of Stochastic Codes 

We code symbols as sufficiently distinct PFSA, and actual communication is carried ouit with binary symbols generated by these stochastic symbol generators

Let \\\(n_0\\\) be the length of symbol stream extracted from each PFSA that results in vaishingly small decoding error.
Then, it is immediate that the rate of such codes is given by:

$$r = \frac{1}{n_0} \log_2 \vert \mathcal{M} \vert $$

Importantly, this is independenty of the actual communicated word length.

From our experiments, we see that for \\\(\vert \mathcal{M} \vert = 2\\\), we have 

$$ n_0 \leqq 10 $$

implying 

$$r \geqq 0.1 $$

# Deletion to Erasure Channel conversion using PFSAs

Can we design a set of PFSA, and then allow a *CANNOT TELL* response, so that the decoding can either say which PFSA was input or is allowed to say *CANNOT TELL* with probability \\\(p\\\). Then we have an erasure channel. The optimization problem will be to minimize n keeping a constraint on p.
