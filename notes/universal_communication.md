# Rate of Stochastic Codes 

We code symbols as sufficiently distinct PFSA, and actual communication is carried ouit with binary symbols generated by these stochastic symbol generators

Let $$n_0$$ be the length of symbol stream extracted from each PFSA that results in vaishingly small decoding error.
Then, it is immediate that the rate of such codes is given by:

$$r = \frac{1}{n_0} \log_2 \vert \mathcal{M} \vert $$
