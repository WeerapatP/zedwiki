# Infant Microbiome Modeling 
+   We have a set of `control variables` namely connected to the mode of feeding (3 modes)
+   We have a set of `internal state` observations in the form of bacterial colonization profiles
+   We have one or more `outcome measures` such as head circumeference measurement as a proxy of cognitive development
+   All these measurements have tagged timestamps

## Aim one: Reverse-engineering the Wiring between control to state to oucome

## Aim two: How Does Perturbations in Internal States or Control Variables Affect the Rest of the Parameters

## How do we incorporate time in the analysis

## Can we carry out modeling at the highest entity resolution?
