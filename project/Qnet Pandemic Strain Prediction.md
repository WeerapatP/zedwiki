# Modeling Drift Characteristics
  
# To Do
## Drift Characteristics
```diff
- HIV multiple clinical phenotypes
- CCHF
- Influenza pdm09
- SARS2
- SARS1
```
## Sequence Predictions
```diff
- maybe part of paper 3
```

## Fast Notebook Example
```diff
- Make a python package that computes the diffusion plots
- Make a python package that makes sequence predictions
```
