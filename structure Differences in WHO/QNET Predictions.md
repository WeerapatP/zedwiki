The accessible surface area (ASA) or solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is the surface area of a biomolecule that is accessible to a solvent. Measurement of ASA is usually described in units of square Ångstroms (a standard unit of measurement in molecular biology). ASA was first described by Lee & Richards in 1971 and is sometimes called the Lee-Richards molecular surface.[1] ASA is typically calculated using the 'rolling ball' algorithm developed by Shrake & Rupley in 1973.[2] Accessible surface area is often used when calculating the transfer free energy required to move a biomolecule from aqueous solvent to a non-polar solvent such as a lipid environment. It is recently suggested that (predicted) accessible surface area can be used to improve prediction of protein secondary structure.[5][6]

We indexed the 200 possible amino acid pairs for their compatibility regarding the three major physicochemical properties – size, charge and hydrophobicity – and constructed Size, Charge and Hydropathy Compatibility Indices and Matrices (SCI & SCM, CCI & CCM, and HCI & HCM). Each index characterized the expected strength of interaction (compatibility) of two amino acids by numbers from 1 (not compatible) to 20 (highly compatible). We found statistically significant positive correlations between these indices and the propensity for amino acid co-locations in real protein structures (a sample containing total 34630 co-locations in 80 different protein structures)
